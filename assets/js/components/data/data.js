			"With a background in nanotech, I naturally enjoy solving problems and  digging in to the technical side of things. Since then I have loved learning new technologies such as frontend frameworks like React, and am always eager to learn more. Currently, I'm working at Foxtel Media as a Digital Advertising Developer and am learning a lot about Ad-tech and the advertising ecosystem. When I am not coding, you can find me trying new restaurants, reading literature, or listening to the soothing melodies of Ludovico Einaudi."
