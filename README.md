# Dev-Starter-Kit

So I built this for all the new web developers... My Goal is to save you time from the bullsh*t of spending hours looking for ways to speed up your learning. Sometimes all we want to do is just code.
(if you are coming from my [youtube channel CodingPhase ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC46wWUso9H5KPQcoL9iE3Ug) I will base all my tutorials from this starter kit)

I broke it down in simple steps to get you going.

## Steps

**Download or Pull This Repo**
	Top of this page you can see where it says clone or download

 **Install Node**
	https://nodejs.org/en/

**Download Atom (OPTIONAL)**
	https://atom.io/

 **Install all the node packages** 
On the root of this project run on your terminal (if you want you can do this with yarn but thats optional)
```bash
    sudo npm install har-validator@latest --save-dev
    sudo npm install
    sudo npm install gulp@3.9.1 -g 
    sudo npm install webpack@4.25.1 -g
    sudo npm install webpack-cli@3.1.2 -g
```

**Start the dev server**
```bash
  npm run watch
```

**Start the dev server with proxy**
```bash
  npm run proxy
```

**Build files for production**
```bash
  npm run build
```

# EACCESS ERROR FIX
```diff
- how to fix the EACCESS ERROR
- lets say for example you trying to install webpack
- sudo npm install webpack@4.25.1 -g
- and get an error
- Error: EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/webpack/node_modules/fsevents/build'
- then try again to install it but with this at the end "--unsafe-perm=true --allow-root"
- for example
- sudo npm install webpack@4.25.1 -g --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root
```
